#  Vigenere Cipher requires a key and a message. It works like this:
#
#  Key:
#      REDDIT
#  Message:
#      TODAYISMYBIRTHDAY
#
#   REDDITREDDITREDDI
#   TODAYISMYBIRTHDAY
#   -----------------

#
#  Using a 0 based alphabet (A=0), R is the 17th letter of the alphabet and
#  T is the 19th letter of the alphabet. (17 + 19) mod 26 = 11 which is where
#  K resides in the alphabet. Repeat for each key/message letter combination
#  until done.
#
#  Today's problem of the day is two part. The first part is to implement
#  a Vigen√®re cipher in the programming language of your choice. Feel free
#  to post solutions or links to solutions in the comments.
#
#  The second part is to try and implement something to crack the message
#  below (the key is 5 or less characters).
